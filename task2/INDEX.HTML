                    Instructions:
                    
                    >Heat a large pan or griddle (tava) on medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of butter.
                    Add minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Sauté for a minute or until the raw smell disappear.
                    Add finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent.                    
                    Add finely chopped bell peppers and cook for a few minutes until they soften.                    
                    Add chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy.                    
                    Add Pav Bhaji masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.                    
                    Add boiled and mashed potatoes, cauliflower, and green peas. Mix everything together.                    
                    Mash the vegetables using a potato masher or the back of a ladle. Keep mashing and stirring until you get a uniform, thick mixture. You can add some water if it's too thick.                    
                    Taste and adjust the seasoning as needed. Add more butter if you like.                    
                    Cut the pav (dinner rolls) in half horizontally.                    
                    Heat a griddle or pan and toast the pav with a little butter until they are lightly browned and crisp.                    
                    Serve the hot and spicy Bhaji with the toasted pav, a dollop of butter, and lemon wedges on the side.                    
                    Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
                    
                    Enjoy your homemade Pav Bhaji!.</p>
